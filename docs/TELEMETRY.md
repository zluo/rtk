# Telemetry

RTK collects anonymous, aggregate usage metrics once per day to help improve the product. Telemetry is **disabled by default** and requires explicit consent during `rtk init` or `rtk telemetry enable`.

## Data Collector

**Entity**: `RTK AI Labs`
**Contact**: contact@rtk-ai.app

## Why we collect telemetry

RTK supports 100+ commands across 15+ ecosystems. Without telemetry, we have no way to know:

- Which commands are used most and need the best filters
- Which filters are underperforming and need improvement
- Which ecosystems to prioritize for new filter development
- How much value RTK delivers to users (token savings in $ terms)
- Whether users stay engaged over time or churn after trying RTK

This data directly drives our roadmap. For example, if telemetry shows that 40% of users run Python commands but only 10% of our filters cover Python, we know where to invest next.

## How it works

1. **Once per day** (23-hour interval), RTK sends a single HTTPS POST to our telemetry endpoint
2. The ping runs in a **background thread** and never blocks the CLI (2-second timeout)
3. A marker file prevents duplicate pings within the interval
4. If the server is unreachable, the ping is silently dropped — no retries, no queue

**Source code**: [`src/core/telemetry.rs`](../src/core/telemetry.rs)

## What is collected

### Identity (anonymous)

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `device_hash` | `a3f8c9...` (64 hex chars) | Count unique installations. SHA-256 of a per-device random salt stored locally (`~/.local/share/rtk/.device_salt`). Not reversible. No hostname or username included. |

### Environment

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `version` | `0.34.1` | Track adoption of new versions |
| `os` | `macos` | Know which platforms to support and test |
| `arch` | `aarch64` | Prioritize ARM vs x86 builds |
| `install_method` | `homebrew` | Understand distribution channels (homebrew/cargo/script/nix) |

### Usage volume

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `commands_24h` | `142` | Daily activity level |
| `commands_total` | `32888` | Lifetime usage — segment light vs heavy users |
| `top_commands` | `["git", "cargo", "ls"]` | Most popular tools (names only, max 5) |
| `tokens_saved_24h` | `450000` | Daily value delivered |
| `tokens_saved_total` | `96500000` | Lifetime value delivered |
| `savings_pct` | `72.5` | Overall effectiveness |

### Quality (filter improvement)

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `passthrough_top` | `["git:15", "npm:8"]` | Top 5 commands with 0% savings — these need filters |
| `parse_failures_24h` | `3` | Filter fragility — high count means filters are breaking |
| `low_savings_commands` | `["rtk docker ps:25%"]` | Commands averaging <30% savings — filters to improve |
| `avg_savings_per_command` | `68.5` | Unweighted average (vs global which is volume-biased) |

### Ecosystem distribution

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `ecosystem_mix` | `{"git": 45, "cargo": 20, "js": 15}` | Category percentages — where to invest filter development |

### Retention (engagement)

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `first_seen_days` | `45` | Installation age in days |
| `active_days_30d` | `22` | Days with at least 1 command in last 30 days — measures stickiness |

### Economics

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `tokens_saved_30d` | `12000000` | 30-day token savings for trend analysis |
| `estimated_savings_usd_30d` | `36.0` | Estimated dollar value saved (at ~$3/Mtok input pricing, Claude Sonnet) |

### Adoption

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `hook_type` | `claude` | Which AI agent hook is installed (claude/gemini/codex/cursor/none) |
| `custom_toml_filters` | `3` | Number of user-created TOML filter files — DSL adoption |

### Configuration (user maturity)

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `has_config_toml` | `true` | Whether user has customized RTK config |
| `exclude_commands_count` | `2` | Commands excluded from rewriting — high count may indicate frustration |
| `projects_count` | `5` | Distinct project paths — multi-project = power user |

### Feature adoption

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `meta_usage` | `{"gain": 5, "discover": 2}` | Which RTK features are actually used |

## What is NOT collected

- Source code or file contents
- Full command lines or arguments (only tool names like "git", "cargo")
- File paths or directory structures
- Secrets, API keys, or environment variable values
- Repository names or URLs
- Personally identifiable information
- IP addresses (not logged server-side)

## Consent

Telemetry requires explicit opt-in consent (GDPR Art. 6, 7). Consent is requested during `rtk init` or via `rtk telemetry enable`. Without consent, no data is sent.

```bash
rtk telemetry status     # Check current consent state
rtk telemetry enable     # Give consent (interactive prompt)
rtk telemetry disable    # Withdraw consent
rtk telemetry forget     # Withdraw consent + delete local data + request server erasure
```

Environment variable override (blocks telemetry regardless of consent):
```bash
export RTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## Retention Policy

- **Server-side**: telemetry records are retained for a maximum of **12 months**, then automatically purged.
- **Client-side**: the local SQLite database (`~/.local/share/rtk/tracking.db`) retains data for **90 days** by default (configurable via `tracking.history_days` in `config.toml`).

## Your Rights (GDPR)

Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to:

- **Access** your data: `rtk telemetry status` shows your device hash; the telemetry payload is fully documented above.
- **Rectification**: since data is anonymous and aggregate, rectification is not applicable.
- **Erasure** (Art. 17): run `rtk telemetry forget` to delete local data and send an erasure request to the server. Alternatively, email contact@rtk-ai.app with your device hash.
- **Restriction of processing**: `rtk telemetry disable` stops all data collection immediately.
- **Portability**: the local SQLite database at `~/.local/share/rtk/tracking.db` contains all locally stored data.
- **Objection**: `rtk telemetry disable` or `export RTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`.

## Erasure Procedure

1. Run `rtk telemetry forget` — this disables telemetry, deletes your device salt and ping marker, and sends an erasure request to the server.
2. If the server is unreachable, the CLI prints fallback instructions with your device hash and the contact email.
3. You can also email contact@rtk-ai.app directly to request manual erasure.

## Data Handling

- Telemetry endpoint URL and auth token are injected at **compile time** via `option_env!()` — they are not in the source code
- All communications use HTTPS (TLS)
- Data is used exclusively for RTK product improvement
- No data is sold or shared with third parties
- Aggregate statistics may be published (e.g. "70% of RTK users are on macOS")

### Server-side Requirements

The telemetry server must implement:
- `POST /erasure` endpoint accepting `{"device_hash": "...", "action": "erasure"}`
- Automatic purge of records older than 12 months
- Audit log for erasure requests (GDPR Art. 17(2) accountability)

## For contributors

The telemetry implementation lives in `src/core/telemetry.rs`. Key design decisions:

- **Fire-and-forget**: errors are silently ignored, never shown to users
- **Non-blocking**: runs in a `std::thread::spawn`, 2-second timeout
- **No async**: consistent with RTK's single-threaded design
- **Compile-time gating**: if `RTK_TELEMETRY_URL` is not set at build time, all telemetry code is dead — the binary makes zero network calls
- **23-hour interval**: prevents clock-drift accumulation that a strict 24h interval would cause

When adding new fields:
1. Add the query method to `src/core/tracking.rs`
2. Add the field to `EnrichedStats` in `src/core/telemetry.rs`
3. Populate it in `get_enriched_stats()`
4. Add it to the JSON payload in `send_ping()`
5. Update this document and the README.md privacy table
6. Ensure the field contains only **aggregate counts or anonymized names** — no raw paths, arguments, or user data
